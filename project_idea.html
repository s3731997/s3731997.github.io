      This project is an application that will provide customizable sports coverage through smartphone apps and smart home devices (like the Google NestHub and Google Nest Mini or the Amazon Echo Show and the Amazon Echo Dot). Its goal is to provide a short real-time summary of the game, similar to Google’s weather report, instead of a full coverage of the event.

      Sport is one of the most watched forms of entertainment in the world, with 4 billion fans of football and 2.5 billion fans of cricket (Shvili 2020)  In the past, sports fans watched TV and listened to the radio for their sports entertainment.  However, many sport fans complained about the limitations of TV and radio, for example, ads, and distraction for work, study and household chores.
 Nowaday, many people have smart devices like Google Home and Amazon Echo in their home, which promise to provide customizable service for things we enjoy, for example, music, recipes, books and news. While there are services for sports entertainment (e.g Google Sport News App, they are not as customizable as other services.   
The motivation for this project is to provide a customizable sport entertainment application that can fit different people in various situations

    The intended audience for this product is sport fans, particularly footy and cricket fans at first, who already use smart devices in their homes. The reason consumers want this service is because they have the convenience  to be able to stay informed about the matches and favorite team.
	The live feed of each match will contain live announcement, by default,  every over or dismissal in cricket, or after every scoring event (goals and behinds) in Aussie Rules, or other scoring events in other sports. The fan will be able to choose when these are announced, what to, and if they want to be interrupted for the announcements.
This product will be able to get news about any sport that has a current sports news feed. The news provided, which may include player interviews, post match commentaries, and other related news, will be for the sports selected by the fans which can also choose which team’s news they wish to see.  When the application launches, it will use existing news feeds for sport, but there are plans to have a dedicated news feed eventually.
This application will include at least cricket, aussie rules football, baseball, basketball, and ice hockey. There will be further sports available as well, including other forms of football.
The way it will work is that each person of this application will have some settings associated with the person. A central server stores the news and live scores in the database.Live scores of matches, and news, will be pushed from the server to the client to update the client as soon as possible. The client will choose which news and scores to convey to the fan, according to the preferences.

    <p>
All of the skills required would be very feasible to find:
 Programming skills and database skills can be found in the labour market
 Software on the smart device would need to be written, however there is plenty of existing code to reference.
The smart devices can be bought easily in Australia.

    Two things will be used to measure success of the application.
      Firstly, the number of downloads, and secondly the amount of star rating and average rating.If the application is successful , 
      it will profoundly improve sport fans enjoyment, by allowing fans to more easily customize their entertrainment notifications. 
      By not requiring fans to listen to the radio, which is not customizable,many fans will enjoy their experience of the sport more.
