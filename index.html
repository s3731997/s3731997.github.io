		Mr. Enoch Liu is a third year Bachelor of IT student at RMIT University, who has had a keen interest in computer and programming since an early age. He was born in Australia with a Chinese cultural heritage, and with parents that maintain a close connection to their birthplace, Hong Kong. Enoch is fluent in English, (as well as Python, Java, C++ and R, just joking!), and is learning to read and write Chinese and Indonesian. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Enoch grew up in Gippsland while his father completed his research in Machine Learning over there. Since then, Enoch has been traveling between Melbourne and Jakarta for a number of years, while his father served as an AUSAid advisor to the Indonesian government. Due to the frequent traveling, Enoch was educated by a private tutor while in Melbourne and aboard (online classes). At 14, Enoch passed the American SAT University Entrance Exam, scoring an outstanding result of the top 1%. He started enrolling in IT subjects at RMIT through Open University when he was 15. Currently, Enoch has completed the majority of technical subjects and a Math minor in his IT degree. COVID-19 has provided the unique opportunity for Enoch to remain in Melbourne while completing the last few subjects involving group work before he will continue on graduate studies.  
		</p>
		<p>
		Enoch is a “geek” who loves to learn about the latest innovations, technologies and games. His favorite pastimes include 1) participating in “Hackathon” which is a kind of innovation development session lasting from a day to a few days, 2) editing Wikipedia articles to improve the knowledge content and presentation, 3) researching retro games (especially Nintendo games) and learning how they work, 4) reading fan fictions that extend the fantasy in games into print media. Enoch loves to hang out at church with his friends and discuss the Bible. He also enjoys learning about Chinese culture, food, people and philosophy. Understanding his own cultural heritage gives him enormous satisfaction and it is a great way to connect with family and friends.
		</p>
		<p>
		In particular, Enoch is an avid gamer in his spare time, whose favorite genres include platformers, fighting games and racing games . His favorites are Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Ni No Kuni, Mario Kart 8, and Minecraft. He also extends the gaming experience from reading fanfiction of those games. When he was young, Enoch always dreamed of becoming a game developer, creating excellent experiences for people to marvel at and enjoy. He tried to make games in Scratch (a block-based visual programming language) when he was 9, and at 12 he developed card games in Python. He still continues to watch indie developers, and secretly wishes that he could make cool games like them. The dream of game development was the initial spark that inspired Enoch to pursue study at RMIT and a future career in IT.

                Enoch is interested in the emerging fields of Quantum Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics in “monetizing” financial data. “Monetizing” means using data, such as customer purchasing records, to better
                understand their spending pattern and form targeted marketing strategies, in order to make money. Quantum computers are predicted to break the current hardware limitations of the conventional computers we use nowadays due to
                its much faster processing speed, and research on its programming is already under way. Artificial Intelligence is becoming more widely used in automated decision making such as search assistants and self-driving cars, in
                order to achieve better cost efficiency in business and convenience in everyday life. Data Analytics in monetizing financial data is revolutionizing banking, finance and insurance industries; the use of mobile payment
                platforms, electronic wallets and wearables are filling data depositories needed for Big Data which could then be utilized for analysis in business strategies that improve profit margins. Enoch is working to position himself
                to capture the opportunities arising from the disruptions these emerging technologies might bring to enable new ways of monetizing financial data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Enoch’s earliest inspiration came from his father’s research in advanced Machine Learning algorithms. Enoch first discovered his own programming ability in Scratch (a block-based visual programming language) at 9, and later
                on at 12 years of age he started extensive programming after reading Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner (Dawson 2005). The programming examples in the book regarding game development sparked his ambition to write
                his own game in the future. Around the same time, Enoch installed Linux on an old computer and experimented with the UNIX Shell programming and Python Interpreter. He also discovered his interests in administering the local
                computer network at home. Enoch is currently working his first job as a part-time intern for a Data Analytic Fintech project. This project uses Big Data to represent stock market and FOREX (foreign exchange) market price
                discovery, and Enoch is learning more about financial market analysis from his colleagues who specialize in those areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                The circumstances when Enoch initially enrolled at RMIT were a little unusual. After passing the American SAT exam, RMIT was the only university to accept Enoch’s enrollment when he was 15. Unlike the American universities,
                almost all Australian universities ruled out enrolment for a 15-year-old student but RMIT University was a noted exception. After enrolling at RMIT, Enoch learned Java and C++, and he was impressed with the teaching style
                and the quality of teaching materials. Enoch chose to enroll in more technical subjects first because he could complete them in his preferred order, and this flexibility fits his traveling schedule well. Most of the course
                materials are well-organized and easy to navigate, which helped him to succeed and achieved top marks for entrance to graduate school in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                During his time at RMIT, Enoch has become proficient in a number of programming languages that provide a solid foundation to enter the job market and continue graduate studies. Enoch expects to further improve the teamwork
                skills learnt from group projects, an ability that will be essential in future employment. In particular, he would like to focus on learning better communication with fellow team members, and how to schedule and budget to
                meet client’s needs and deadlines. IT exists to serve the purpose of human’s needs in business, medical, social or other settings; the technologies do not stand alone without a purpose. To learn how to realize IT’s potential
                in improving human life is the central issue that Enoch is keen to gain better understanding of in his remaining journey at RMIT. He will be working diligently to finalize the group projects before completing his IT degree
                in the next 12 months.

            <h2>Position Description</h2>
            <p>
                The above advertisement is a recruitment listing for a software developer position in a fintech company, which is a leader in payment systems and fraud detection. The role of software developer is expected to develop and
                maintain a new mobile payment platform, involving mobile wallets and wearables. The developer is also expected to work with other developers and analysts as a team. Secure APIs will also be developed to access the payment
                system, and message queues will be used to process the high amount of real time payments that will take place. This position will be challenging as real time payment processing requires fast response time and a high
                expectation of uninterrupted service, in order to ensure smooth financial transactions. Any service breakdowns will cause huge financial loss to the client and significantly reduce customer satisfaction. The developer is
                expected to be a team player who works with other IT professionals in the company.
            </p>
            <h2>Why This Position is Appealing</h2>
			<p>
            There are a number of reasons why this job advertisement is attractive (to me personally).<br> Firstly, mobile payment platforms are an emerging field in IT. The challenges and career opportunities will be relatively abundant, and
            the remunerations will be generous because these skills are highly sought after but the available skilled IT professionals are few. The flexible work arrangements and the opportunity to try a wide range of tasks are very
            appealing to a graduate who is just starting out in the job market. Secondly, this position aligns with my own experience as an intern in a fintech project and my goal to establish myself in the technological applications in the
            fintech industry. The prospect of advancing my IT career into more senior positions is excellent in a well resourced fintech firm (not a start-up), where the budget is available for a competent IT team.
			</p><p>Thirdly, this position is
            for an established company with an impressive client list, including big corporations and the government. Working in such a company will help me to develop a professional network that will enhance my career advancement in the
            future. The colleagues and clients who I will work with, will be important references for future employers. Finally, work experience from this company will complement my planned graduate studies in Artificial Intelligence and
            Quantum Computing. Automated real time payment approval is an increasingly important application area of automated decision making in Artificial Intelligence, while high-speed real-time fraud detection will be relevant to the
            application of Quantum Computing when the hardware becomes available.</p>
