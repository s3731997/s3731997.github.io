Hi, I am Enoch. I turned 19 a few days ago. My parents are originally from Hong Kong, but they have lived in Australia for nearly three decades. 
  Although my parents are fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese and English, I am only fluent in English and Python, but I also speak a little Indonesian, Mandarin, C++ and R. 
  Oh, I should mention that both of my parents speak Python and C++, and my dad is also fluent in R.
I was born in Sydney, but have mostly lived in Victoria. For the past nine years, my family and I have called the Melbourne area home, although my dad has spent a lot of time working overseas. Until the beginning of COVID, my dad was working as an IT consultant for a company in Indonesia; lately he has been working from home.  I am currently doing some internship work for him
Because I was homeschooled for high school, I have been able to take some Open University Courses to supplement my studies for about three years. I am currently a little over half way through the RMIT Information Technology Degree (yes, you are right, I have done this backwards). 
My favorite pastimes are: surfing the web, editing Wikipedia articles, researching retro games (especially Nintendo games), hanging out at church with my friends, and talking about God.  I am a Christian, and believe that there is a God and that He is the Great Programmer of this world.
