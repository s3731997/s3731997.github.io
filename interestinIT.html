    I have been fascinated by IT since I was about 9, and discovered Scratch.  However, my interest in programming really started when I was 12 or 13, when I read an old Python book of my dad’s called Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner (Dawson 2005). This book inspired me to learn everything I could about Python and other computer languages.  Around the same time, I put Linux on an old computer and experimented with the Shell and Python Interpreter. When my dad is away, I am the one who keeps all our household computer equipment running smoothly.  After enrolling in RMIT, I learned Java and C++, and experimented with programming a fractions class.  At the present, I am doing some statistical financial programming for one of my dad’s projects.

    My first class in Open University was RMIT’s Discrete Maths. I initially chose it because it looked interesting.  By the time I had finished the course, I was impressed with RMIT’s class style and with the quality of their teaching material.  I chose to enroll in more computer science subjects with RMIT because you can do them in any order, most of them are well-organised and easy to navigate, and to date I have done reasonably well.

    Besides programming, I hope to learn how to do group projects well, as I have not had opportunities to do this in high school.  I hope to finish my IT degree over the next few years, perhaps taking some courses on the RMIT campus rather than through Open University.  My ultimate goal is to use the skills I have acquired to get a job in the computer industry.
