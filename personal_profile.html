Because the tests that I found were free, and their quality was unknown to me,  I decided to take two of each kind to confirm that the results were valid. 
Myers-Briggs Test
I took two Myers-Briggs type tests , one from Truity and one from Personality Max. I liked Truity’s test format better because it had more options than the Max Test. Truity’s questions allowed you to respond via a Likert scale with seven options, whereas Max’s frequently only gave the option of ‘agree’ or ‘disagree’.  However, the Max Test gave more discussion about what the scores meant.
The Truity Test reported that the top three matches for my personality were: 
ENFP (Extraverted, Intuition,Feeling,Perceiving)
ENTP (Extraverted,Intuition,Thinking,Perceiving)
INTP (Introverted, Intuition, Thinking, Perceiving)
The Truity test gave me the following percentages for each category
Extraverted	55		Introverted	44
Sensing  	40 	   	Intuition 	60
Thinking 	52      		Feeling 	48
Perceiving 	74 		Judging 	26
The Max Test reported that my personality most closely matched 
	INTP (Introverted, Intuition, Thinking, Perceiving)
The Max test gave me the following percentages for each category
Extraverted      37      		Introverted  	63
Sensing  	 42 	 	Intuition 	58
Thinking 	 74     		Feeling 	26
Perceiving 	 89 		Judging 	11
The two tests seem to indicate that my personality is somewhat evenly divided between Extravert and Introvert (perhaps based on the situation), very evenly divided between Sensing and Intuition, and that I am generally more of a Thinker than a Feeler (possibly based on the situation), and very much more of a Perceiver than a Judger.  

Learning Style Test
I took a Learning Style Tests from Personality Max
Personality Max said that I was a visual learner.  The Personality Max Test gave the following scores for my Learning Style was:
Visual 62
Auditory 46
Kinesthetic 33

Big Five Personality Test
This test measures the OCEAN factor in a person; that is, Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism.  I received the following scores when I took the Big Five from Truity7:

Openness		56%
Conscientiousness:	21%
Extraversion		69%
Agreeableness	81%
Neuroticism		35%

The results indicate that I am open, distactable, agreeable, and somewhat less likely to be sad than the average person.  It is interesting to note that this test also classified me as an extravert, which makes the Max Test’s results even more questionable.

What the Results Mean to Me
The results  seem to describe me very well. I suspect the reason I am classified as extraverted in one test and introverted in the other test is that I am good at meeting people, but not very good at maintaining conversation. Verbal communication is very challenging for me, and I would not actively pursue a vocation or activity that required these skills. The results also show the tendency to get bored with unchallenging work, which is why I did some of the third year programming courses before many of the first year courses. I will try to work harder on verbal communication and management of boredom.

How the Results May Influence My Behavior in a Team
If I was part of a team, my flexible, easy-going nature would allow me to accept the ideas of others and to accommodate their plans.  However I may not want to explain my complicated ideas to other people at all, or when pushed to do so, I may go into too much detail. I will tend to be quite flexible with changes in plans. However I do have a tendency to become bored quickly if the work is not challenging.  If I lose interest, it will be a big struggle for me to produce quality contributions.

Considerations When Forming a Team
I will probably work best if given a challenging task to complete on my own. I may not be good at either collaborative teamwork or work that is mundane. I will enjoy the challenge of a complex problem, but may procrastinate about getting my solutions down on paper.
While I will be able to spot inconsistencies in the completed project, I will find ‘fine tuning’ it tedious and boring. If working on a team, I could be relied upon to do a very meticulous final proofread, but should not be the one responsible for making the website attractive, or for seeing that everyone completes their work in a timely manner.
Because I have taken several programming courses, I would probably be able to figure out what will and won’t work in programming.
